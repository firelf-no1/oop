=  Implementation details   =
=============================
drunkard ship - i designed the ship to escape and fire away from any nerby ship.
special ship - i designed the special ship to escape from any nearby ship and if a ship
gets to a distance of 0.15 units from the ship, the ship will fire in 6 diraction and 
telaport from the location.

I add a special class of physics to make the special ship fireing possible
