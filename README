=============================
Book.java - represents a book, which has a title, author, year of publication and different literary aspects
Patron.java - represents a library patron that has a name and assigns values to different literary aspects of
              books.
Library.java - represents a library, which hold a collection of books. Patrons can register at the library to
               be able to check out books, if a copy of the requested book is available.

=          Design           =
=============================
I made a get function in the book class so i can call for the parameters in the patron class to calculate the book score
I add two arrays to the patron class to keep track of the books they rad or where suggested so the library won't suggest
a book they already red or a book they didn't want to read.
I added the arrays to the patron him self so when he wanted to move to a new library the system there won't suggest
a book he already red or a book he didn't want to read.

Do to the fact that I submitted the ex so late I added a couple of methods that I think should be in a library:
    With user interaction:
        removing a book from the library.
        removing a patron from the library.
    Without user interaction:
        a search in the library for a book title.
        a search in the library for a specific author.
        i made the last two public do it can be used from outside the library


=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
For each book, it is possible to set an ID number of only one patron, since it is not possible that two
patrons borrow the same book at the same time.

Patron can be registered in several libraries.
Each library has an array representing the number of books each patron has borrowed, so each patron can borrow
from each library the number of books that may be lent to it.
